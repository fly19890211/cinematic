Cinematic
===========

A meteor app to easily list, sort, and organize your movies. View poster art and watch trailers without effort.

This app was created as an exploratory dive into the world of [meteor](http://meteor.com).

Meteor experiment, but it's sweet.

Have lots of digital movies? This is designed to help you corral them and pick a movie for the night.

Uses TMDB to look up release date, poster, description, rating, and trailer and display them in an organized fashion.

##### Help me out!

Eventually the final of this project will be based on meteor 1.0.0, whenever that is. Pull requests to the right >>

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

Next you will need to install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) to get npm.
