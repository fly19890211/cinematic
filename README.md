Cinematic
===========

Have lots of digital movies on a local hard drive? This is made for you.

A meteor app to easily list, sort, and organize your movies. View poster art and watch trailers without effort.

This app was created as an exploratory dive into the world of [meteor](http://meteor.com). Currently Meteor version 1.1.0.3.

Uses TMDB and OMDB to look up release date, poster, description, rating, and trailer and display them in an organized fashion.

# Installation

Download or clone the repo `lacymorrow/cinematic`. 

You will need to have meteor installed. On a *NIX system this can be accomplished with the following command:

`curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh`

Next you will need to install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) and npm if not included.

`cd` into the `cinematic` directory and run `meteor` to quickstart the application on http://localhost:3000.
