Have lots of digital movies on a local hard drive? This is made for you.

A meteor app to easily list, sort, and organize your movies. View poster art and watch trailers without effort.

This app was created as an exploratory dive into the world of [meteor](http://meteor.com). Currently Meteor version 1.1.0.3.

Uses TMDB and OMDB to look up release date, poster, description, rating, and trailer and display them in an organized fashion.
